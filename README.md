# Most Stones Within Manhattan Distance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program reads a file with information for stone locations on a grid and the Manhattan distances to use.
Using dynamic programming, a memoization grid is created, showing information of all stones contained within the square/rectangle from the bottom left corner to each grid location as the top right corner. With this memoization grid, we are able to calculate the number of stones in a desired square and see which location has the greatest number of stones within the manhattan distance.

Tests and inputs are given to use the constructed solution.
